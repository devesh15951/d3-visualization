                    <p>This online community and the Consortium for the Science of Sociotechnical Systems (CSST) serves as a trans-discipline community, connecting like-minded scholars from many different intellectual communities. CSST brings together researchers
                      from a wide range of disciplines to develop a common language and scholarly repertoire as we work to understand diverse sociotechnical issues. Research on human activity such as collaboration, creativity, learning and economic production
                      in domains like healthcare, education, science, leisure, and computing requires researchers to understand both social and technical aspects of human organization. Thatâ€™s what we do.</p>
                    <h2>Acknowledge CSST in your work</h2>
                    <p>Are you a researcher who has benefitted from participation in our workshops and events? Please consider acknowledging the CSST RCN in your publications. Here is some boilerplate text for you to use and extend:</p>
